// this file determines when automatic JSON validation should be performed
// each key must be the filename of a JSON schema file
// each value must be a non-empty list of valid C# regular expressions (e.g., ["blah.*\\.txt"]
// thus, if this file contained {"c:\\path\\to\\foo_schema.json": ["blah.*\\.txt"]}
// it would automatically perform validation using "c:\\path\\to\\foo_schema.json" whenever a ".txt" file with the substring "blah" in its name was opened.
