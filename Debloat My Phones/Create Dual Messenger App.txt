Step 1: Enable Dual Messenger for an existing app (e.g. WhatsApp).

Step 2: Enable USB Debugging and connect your device to your computer.

Step 3: Open command prompt in your adb folder.

Step 4: Type
adb shell pm list users

Step 5: In the resulting list, find the user named "DUAL_APP" and get its number. For example, the number is 95 on my device:
UserInfo{95:DUAL_APP:20000030} running

Step 6: Type
exit

Step 7: Have your desired apk file on your pc.

Step 8: Type
adb install --user 95 "Path to apk"

Remember to replace "95" with whatever number you saw in Step 5.

Wait for the process to finish. A SUCCESS message should be displayed.

The app of your choice will now be installed in Dual Messenger.
